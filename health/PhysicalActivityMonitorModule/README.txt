The implementation contains three Eclipse
projects. 

1. app.biomedicalsensors.server: This project 
   contains the source code about the service 
   provider that communicates directly with 
   the bluetooth sensor.

2. app.biomedicalsensors.uiclient: This project 
   contains the source code about the service 
   client.

3. ont.biomedicalsensors: This project contains
   the source code about the biomedical sensors 
   ontology.

4. eclipse.launchers: This folder contains the 
   launch file for the deployment of the 
   module (service).

5. external-jars: This folder contains the 
   necessary .jar libraries  for the bluetooth
